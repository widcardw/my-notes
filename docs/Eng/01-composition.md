#### Answer

_As a loyal/regular/faithful reader of your newspaper_ who pays great attention to "White Polution", I am writing for the purpose of _expressing my opinions and making some/certain suggestions_.

From my perspective, plastic bags are characterized/featured by the damage to the environment. Thus it is great necessity to restrict/limit the use of them. However, compared with the public expectation/hope, restrictions on plastic bags have not been so successfully or  satisfactory in our city. Accordingly, it is advisable for your newspaper to more report the seriousness of "White Polution", which will bring readers the awareness of environmental protection, arouse their passion for loving environment and help to reduce the use of plastic bags. In addition, you are supposed to educate and encourage readers to use paper or cloth bags instead of plastic ones.

I believe/deem that with our _joint/shared_ efforts, "White Polution" will _be reduced/alleviated and even be eliminated_.
