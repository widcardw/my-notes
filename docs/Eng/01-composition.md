## Chart

### 全球手机市场

#### Directions

In this section, you are asked to write an essay based on the following chart. In your writing, you should

1. Interpret the chart and
2. Give your comments

#### Answer

Given is a column chart, clearly illustrating the remarkable contrasts in mobile-phone subscription between developing and developed nations from 2000 to 2008. During this period, the subscription in developed countries showed a slight grown, from 600 milloin to 900 million. Then it remained stable at 1 billion in 2007 and 2008. By contrast, the number of mobile phones sold in developing countries was merely 500 million, but it surged sharply, reaching the peak at 4 billion in 2008. 

Such statistics can be associaated with the rapid advance in the global mobile phone industry, but what resulted in the differences above? To my understanding, at least two fundamental causes can account for this phenomenon. For one thing, in recent years, developing countries were characterized by their economic boom, which enabled residents there to possess additional money to purchase and utilize mobile phones. A case in points is China. For another, compared with developing countries, developed nations enjoyed a smaller market, due to thier smaller population. So, it displayed the trend of saturation. 

Accordingly, mobile phone manufactures are supposed to pay more attention to the market in developing nations, because of its huge potential. In addition, it is advisable for them to work out comprehensive strategies to consolidate themarket in developed countries. If they do their utmost, the future of mobile-phone industry will be promising. 

### 兼职工作

This is a column chart, clearly illustrating the striking contrasts in part-time jobs by college students in certain university. Overall, seniors have the largest proportion of part-time jobs, with 88.24%. Then the next are juniors and sophomores, at 71.93% and 71.13% respectively. Finally come freshmen, with 67.77%. It is also noticeable that over half of students in four grades take part-time jobs. 

Such statistics can be associated with the popularity of leisure-time jobs among youngsters in college, but what result in this phenomenon? For one thing, college life is characterized by two long vacations, which enable students in college to have adequate spare time to broaden thier horizons and gain additional income by doing part-time jobs. For another, compared with students in lower grades, seniors possess richer professional knowledge, greater demand for working experience and less courses. So, a larger percentage of them take part-time positions. 

As an adult student, I deem that it is nessary for us to do part-time jobs, which may bring us an oppotunity to know the society, arouse our passion for life and help us ease our financial burden. 

### 春节花销比例

Given is a pie chart, clearly illustrating the striking contrasts in (the proportions of) the spending by citizens/residents in a certain city of China during the Spring Festival. Overall, the expense on new year gifts is the largest percentage, with 40%. Then, the next are the expenditure on transportation and gatherings for the dinner, at the same 20%. 

The statistics above, apparently, can be associated with a variety of ways in which Chinese celebrate the String Festival, but what result in this phenomenon? For one thing, the Spring Festival vacattion is characterized by the fact that during this period, Chinese usually visit thier relatives and friends to express their wishes to each other and give presents. This definitely enables the New-Year gifts to be the largest part of spending. For another, compared with the past years, more youngsters pursue their academic achievement and work in other cities, but they choose to go back home to celebrate the new year by having dinners together with their family members, relatives or friends. Thus, part of the mony is spent on transportation and gatherings for dinners. 

### 中国汽车市场

This is a column chart the clearly illustrates the dramatic changes in China's market shares among Chinese, American and Japanese car brands from 2008 to 2009. During the period, the share of Chinese brands ascended remarkably, reaching approximately 33%. By contrast, Japanese brands displayed a sharp decline, from 35% to 25%. Meanwhile, the percentage of American brands remained stable at 15%. 

Such statistics can be associated with the fierce competition in China's car market, but what resulted in the changes above? For one thing, in recent years, Chinese automobiles were characterized by the lower prices and improved quality, which attracted more Chinese customers to choose their national brands. For another, compared with the past, the Sino-Japanese relation got worse and a larger proportion of residents in China did not purchase Japanese products, in cluding cars. 

As a result, Chinese manufactures are supposed to pay more attention to the domestic (国内) market, due to its great potential. Meanwhile, it is essential for them to work out comprehensive strategies to strengthen their quality and after-sales service. After all, only superior products and service can bring firms the competitive edge and help them to win the market. 


### 城镇人口

Given is a column chart, clearly illustrating the striking contrasts in populations between rural and urban areas in China from 1990 to 2010. In/During these two decades, the population in the countryside descended sharply, from over 800 million to approximately 670 million. However, the number of residents in cities displayed a remarkable growth, from 300 million to less than 670 million. 

Such statistics can be associated with the speedy process of urbanization in China, but what resulted in the above phenomenon? For one thing, in the past decades, China was characterized by the economic prosperity and boom, which enabled a host of families in rural areas to possess addition/extra financial power to purchase houses in cities and reside there. For another, compared with the past years, a larger precentage/proportion of college graduates chose to work and live in cities. Thus, the city population became larger. 

Accordingly, the authorities are supposed to pay more attention to a variety of problems caused by the population explosion in cities, such as traffic jams, the environmental pollution and the lack of education resources. Meanwhile, it is essential for them to work out comprehensive strategies to narrow the gap between urban and rural areas.

Then, the second/next is reducing/relieving/releasing/easing the pressure, with 33%. Finally come making friends and cultivating/fostering/developing independence, at 9% and 6% respectively. 

This chart, apparently, can be associated with the significance of traveling.

In additon, compared with others, college students suffer/endure/bear more mental stress due to their more academic assignments. Thus, a host of them relieve the pressure by traveling. Of course, traveling can also bring students opportunities of fostering independence, arouse their passion for life and help them make more friends. 

As a senior who is preparing for the national entrance examination for postgraduates, I have no time for traveling and I am fond of studying in the library in spare time.
