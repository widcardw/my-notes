### 漫画

As is vividly shown in the comic, a bottle fell down with half of water poured out. A man complains that it all messed up, and he cannot have any water, but the other feels lucky since there is still some water remaining.

The comic reveals that some people hold negative attitude towards life, and they could not gain anything but failure. However, those who always put a positive spin on things can grab the chances and then lead their life to success.

### 漫画

As is vividly shown in the picture, a host of tourists are sitting on a boat, enjoying the scenery, and throwing rubbish into the river, regardless of the garbages including plastic bags, bottles, metal cans, floating in the water. The caption of the comic reveals the phenomenon that people enjoy traveling, but at the meantime they leave garbages everywhere. We may draw a conclusion that visitors, lacking awareness of environmental protection pose a threat to the ecological balance of the tourist attractions by leaving behind a huge amount of rubbish.

There are many reasons to explain this unpleasant scene. Firstly, many tourists do not have a strong sense of environmental protection and are not well educated the consequences of pollution. Secondly, people channel all their attention to the economical growth brought about by tourism, taking no notice of the great pressure tourism has exerted on the environment, as is portrayed in the cartoon.

To conclude, it is urge to take effective measures to change the current situation. For one thing, we should continue to promote and popularize the awareness of environmental protection. For another, more rules should be made and carried out by the government to restrain people from polluting and destroying the environment. All in all, we are supposed to make joint efforts to create clean and pollution-free surroundings.

First of all, we are deeply moved by the noble cause Project Hope and inspired by its achievements. As a result, all of us agree to do our little bit by providing financial support for a child in a remote area in Sichuan Province. Second, we will find a girl who has just started school but whose family cannot afford it. Last, we plan to pay her tuition every year until she graduates from middle school. We will remit the donation directly to a local bank account opened by her family.
