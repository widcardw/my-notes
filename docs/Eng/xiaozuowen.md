### 欢迎国际生

Dear international students,

I am quite delighted to hear that you are coming to my university. I'd like to extend our warmest welcome to all of you on behalf of the Students' Union. I am writing for the purpose of providing some suggestions for the life in campus here.

To begin with, we will provide volunteers who are fluent at English so that you can quickly fit in the lifestyle here and address the culture shock. In addition, you are supposed to participate in various activities and establish friendship with schoolmates as to make your campus life colorful. Moreover, you should remember that anyone ought to keep pace with lessons and not to fail in exams.

With these advice kept in mind, I deem that you will enjoy your life here. I am looking forward to seeing you soon.

Yours,
Li Ming

### 漫画

As is vividly shown in the comic, a bottle fell down with half of water poured out. A man complains that it all messed up, and he cannot have any water, but the other feels lucky since there is still some water remaining.

The comic reveals that some people hold negative attitude towards life, and they could not gain anything but failure. However, those who always put a positive spin on things can grab the chances and then lead their life to success.
